         <h1>Afghanistan</h1>
         <small>Islamic Republic</small>
         <p>Afghanistan, multiethnic landlocked country located in the heart of south-central Asia. Lying along important trade
         routes connecting southern and eastern Asia to Europe and the Middle East, Afghanistan has long been a prize sought by
         empire builders, and for millennia great armies have attempted to subdue it, leaving traces of their efforts in great
         monuments now fallen to ruin. The country's forbidding landscape of deserts and mountains has laid many imperial
         ambitions to rest, as has the tireless resistance of its fiercely independent peoples—so independent that the country
         has failed to coalesce into a nation but has instead long endured as a patchwork of contending ethnic factions and
         ever-shifting alliances.</p>

         <h3>Kabul</h3>
         <img src="/images/pexels-qasim-mirzaie-14311525.jpg" alt="shah e doshamshera e wali">
         <p>Kabul, Persian Kābol, city, capital of the province of Kabul and of Afghanistan. The largest urban centre in the country
         and also its political and economic hub, the city forms one of several districts of Kabul province. It lies at the
         intersection of roads that lead to Uzbekistan (via Mazār-e Sharīf) to the north, Pakistan (via Jalālābād) to the east,
         and Kandahār to the south. A settlement has existed at or near Kabul for some 3,500 years, but it was not until the
         early 20th century that the city extended north of the Kabul River.</p>
